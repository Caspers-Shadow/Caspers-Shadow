      <h2>Who am I</h2>
      <p>I'm a curious and creative individual who enjoys expressing myself through singing, crocheting, painting, and performing on stage — even though I’m naturally more introverted. I’ve always been fascinated by how things work, which sparked my interest in engineering and IT from a young age, thanks to shows like MythBusters, How It’s Made, and Bones.

That early curiosity led me to explore basic coding on an iPad, and over time, it grew into a passion for Information Technology. I'm currently working toward an IT qualification, which opens up a world of opportunities to innovate, problem-solve, and make a real impact.

Alongside my technical goals, I stay grounded in creativity and community. I’ve contributed my voice to charity events and dedicate time to volunteering for animal rescue causes. I'm reliable, goal-driven, and always eager to learn — with a strong work ethic that helps me follow through on what I set out to achieve.</p>
